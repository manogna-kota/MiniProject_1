# Skillsync

Skillsync is a college level mobile application for communication about ongoing academic or technical events.

Our mobile app streamlines communication
between college faculty and students, serving as a centralized platform for hackathons, workshops, presentations, certification courses, and internships.

Faculty effortlessly post event details, while students can access and register.
Timely reminders and an organized system enhance engagement, fostering a connected academic community, empowering students in skill-building and professional development.


Our team will be working with Android Studio Hedgehog (version 2023.1.1) for this project.

Here's how to install it:

1. Download the installer: Head to the official Android Studio website: https://developer.android.com/studio. Scroll down to the installation section for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Locate the download for Android Studio Hedgehog (usually under "Past Releases").

2. Run the installer: Once downloaded, double-click the installer file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions: These will typically involve accepting license agreements and choosing an installation location on your computer.
4. Optional customization (Windows only): You can uncheck the option to start Android Studio automatically after installation if you prefer to launch it manually later.
5. Complete the installation: Click "Finish" to finalize the process.
